description: In What's Wrong With The World Chesterton rightly points out that what
  people see as ""wrong with the world"" are only the symptoms of a deeper problem.
  He shows that our governments, be they capitalistic or socialistic, also fail to
  see the deeper problem. With a keen wit and lively prose he cuts directly to the
  true problems that society must deal with and his solutions feel utterly correct.
